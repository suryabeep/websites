      <h4>Bring Back Profitability with the Last Mile Wiz Model</h4>
      <p>
        Ever wondered how big CPG companies distribute products in emerging markets like India, Brazil, Africa and other South East Asian countries where small Mom-and-Pop stores dot the country-side and organized brick-and-mortar retail is almost non-existent? <br><br>
        They do this by appointing “Redistribution Stockists” (RS) in every town, district and suburb. Redistribution Stockists receive merchandise from CPG companies and then distribute them within their locality (typically a 15-20 mile radius). This model works financially for CPG companies as well as for the multitude of Redistribution Stockists. <br><br>
        This model is almost non-existent in the USA. Mega-companies dominate the market. You, as the brand owner, are paying exorbitant freight cost to big freight companies for delivering your order to millions of customers. Let’s face it – you are not in a position to match the might of Amazon Prime and Walmart Plus and deliver unlimited merchandise overnight at zero cost to your customers.<br><br>
      </p>
      <h4>You need a strategy to stay profitable and grow your business.</h4>
      <p>
        The only sensible and sustainable way is to reach out to your customers across the United States through the RS Model of distribution. This is where Last Mile Wiz comes in. <br><br>
        You only need to make a minor change in your business model. Simply ship your merchandise in a jumbo box once a week to a Last Mile Wiz location through any of the major freight carriers - that way, you pay minimum freight charges to the freight carrier as it will be delivering your merchandise to a single point. This is called consolidated shipping and ensures you get the best possible rates. LMW will ensure your customer receives their order over the weekend directly delivered at their doorstep. Guaranteed. <br><br>
        You'd pay Last Mile Wiz <b>$0</b>  for stocking your merchandise for a week and <b>$5</b> per customer order delivery. Same if we have to pick up a return item from your customer. <br><br>
        The math is compelling. We have got your back!
