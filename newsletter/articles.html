          <h5>Inventory Management as a Service: Battling the Out-of-Stock Phenomenon</h5>
          <p>Is there anything more frustrating than walking through the aisles of your local supermarket or convenience store trying to check items off your shopping list only to find empty space where your item should be? You can see it is supposed to be positioned there, where you always find it, but none are available to select. Could it be misplaced on a nearby shelf, maybe some in the back to be restocked, maybe completely sold out? There is no way to tell. That’s because there seems to be a gap between the shopping list and what is actually available in that particular store... </p>

          <h5>Retail Technology Trends: Cyber Security</h5>
          <p>Since the start of 2018, at least 19 retailers and consumer companies were hacked and likely had information stolen from them. Many of these breaches were caused by flaws in payment systems that were taken advantage of by hackers. Furthermore, according to a study by KPMG, 19% of consumers said they would completely stop shopping at a retailer after a breach, and 33% said they would take a break from shopping there for an extended period. Cyber security and privacy continues to be a focus for investment from a systems perspective.
            <br>

          <h5>J Crew Exits Bankruptcy</h5>
          <p>Finally some good news. I hope it is not temporary. J.Crew needs significant customer engagement platforms to bring back the lost glory. One piece of advice from a fan - bring some music, train your associates to talk to customers and engage them.</p>
